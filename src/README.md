# TypeScript Fundamentals Playground

This is a hands-on playground for learning TypeScript fundamentals. The project includes examples and exercises for basic types, interfaces, generics, and more.

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── 01-basic-types.ts    # Basic types and interfaces examples
├── 02-generics.ts       # Generics and advanced types examples
├── index.ts            # Main file with examples and exercises
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the examples:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## What You'll Learn

### Basic Types (`01-basic-types.ts`)

- String, number, boolean types
- Arrays and tuples
- Enums
- Interfaces and types
- Function type annotations
- Optional parameters

### Generics and Advanced Types (`02-generics.ts`)

- Generic functions
- Generic interfaces and classes
- Type constraints
- Union and intersection types
- Type guards

### Practice Exercises (`index.ts`)

1. Sum of array
2. Product interface
3. Generic array function
4. Type-safe function for string/number

## How to Use

1. Read through the example files
2. Try modifying the examples
3. Complete the practice exercises
4. Create your own examples

## Tips for Learning

- Start with `01-basic-types.ts` to understand the fundamentals
- Move to `02-generics.ts` once you're comfortable with basic types
- Use the TypeScript compiler to catch errors:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Experiment with the code and see how TypeScript helps catch errors
